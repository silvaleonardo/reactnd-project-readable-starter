# Readable Project

This is the project for the final evaluation project of the Redux course at Udacity, where a Web application for content and comments was created. Users will be able to post content to pre-defined categories, comment on their posts and posts from other users, and vote on posts and comments. Users can also edit and delete posts and comments.

## Start

To get started project:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, install and start the front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
